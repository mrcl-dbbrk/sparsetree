# sparsetree
**DISCLAIMER**: You probably should not rely on this software at this point. I'm just trying things out here.

sparsetree lets you create n-dimensional sparse trees of specific maximum depth and any type that implements PartialEq + Copy.
At this point only few operations are supported, namely changing and retrieving the value at a specific coordinate.
